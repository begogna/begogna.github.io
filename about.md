	 I always had an eye for detail.
	 I love small things and my favourite shots are macros. 
	 I am also fascinated by the mathematic perfection we find in nature. I like to work with my hands, since I was a kid I was always crafting something. <br>
	 That's why after graduating in Computer Science Engineering and several years working as a software developer I decided to move towards something more artistic. I studied 3D computer graphics and I have been doing 3D modeling and design ever since. When I discovered 3D printing I realised that it puts together all my expectations: from the design passing by the CAD creation to be physically touching the result.
	 <br>
	 I also like to help others making their ideas become real, to feel unique in a world of mass production.<br><br> 
	 I am convinced additive manufactoring is the future. It is evolving very fast and I absolutly want to be part of it.
