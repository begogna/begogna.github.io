Begoña Pérez Rodríguez
======================

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Welcome to my portfolio !<br>
I'm a Spanish girl living in France and I work as a freelance 3D modeler. I am passionate about crafting and design, that's why after several years working as a software developer I decided to study 3D computer graphics. Then I discovered 3D printing and I have no doubt that is the future and I absolutly want to be part of it. 
You can take a look of my work in

or shop some of my models in my online shops below.</p>
