Begoña Pérez Rodríguez
======================

<p>Hi !</p>
<p>Welcome to my portfolio. Here I show some of my creations, clasified by fields.</p>
<p>I'm a Spanish girl living in France. I am passionate about crafting and design. That's why after several years working as a software developer I decided to study 3D computer graphics. Then I discovered 3D printing and I have no doubt that is the future and I absolutly want to be part of it. I do 3D modeling for 3D printing as a freelance and also in my spare time for myself or friends. You can take a look of my work in this site and in my social media links.</p>
<p>See you around !</p>

<!-- After graduating in Computer Science Engineering I worked as software developer for almost five years. Then I decided to follow my passion and free my creativity. I studied 3D computer graphics in Lyon and then started 3D modeling as a freelance. My models are mostly for 3D printing, as I've always liked to create physical objects. I believe this technology is the future and I want to be one of the first participating in the development of it. -->
