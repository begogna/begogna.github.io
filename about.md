#About Begoña

After graduating in Computer Science Engineer in 2010 and working for almost five years as developer I decided to follow my passion and to free my creativity. I studied one year 3D design, animation and motion graphics at private school ARIES Lyon and then I continued practising by myself. Currently I am concentrated in modelling for 3d printing, but and I like also the architecture and interior design domains, among others.
