The pictures are taken from the path that are defined in config.yml. When a small picture is required, it is taken from the folder
thumnails (baseurl_posts_img:'/assets/images/posts/'). When a big picture is required, from the folder hero (baseurl_featured_img: '/assets/images/hero/')

The name of the picture is defined inside the header of the post, under "image,feature", so you have to have a picture with this name in both folders. It can be the same or different, but the size has to be coherent with the usage.

The files in _site are autogenerated !! don't change it !!!

CSS:
In default.html we call head.html which says where are the CSS files (in our case in assets/css/main.css)
At the beggining of that file you need to have a comment to make jekyll read it.
Then, to make jekyll find the files included in that main.css you have to have them in the folder called _sass, where jeckyll will look for the files (unless you have another name of the folder and you include it in the _config.yml)
